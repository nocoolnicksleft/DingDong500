###DingDong500

Alarm clock, ARM-Based for playing MP3 songs from SD Card.

Small stereo amplifier and speakers included. As seen on the photos the case has since been re-dedicated to other projects. Very neat matrix VFD display. Nothing like the unreadable 2x20 LCD crap.

Not spectacular now, but quite something in 2004...
